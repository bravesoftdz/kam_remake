Music:
+	Music does not play
	Audio playback can be choppy/glitchy on crappy VMs/Systems

Map loading/saving:
+	singleplayer seems to work fine, multiplayer hangs on choosing the map
+	saving a map seems to make it hang in a similar way (out of memory error)

Cursor:
	Cursor is broken when hovering an input field
	Wrong cursors while scrolling gameplay interface
	Scrolling to the right happens way before the cursor reaches the right edge of the window

Debug menu:
+	Status bar does not show labels
+	Debug menu elements overlapping/hidden
	GTK2 TTrackBar does not obey Tick rules and "slides freely", enabling TickStyle renders a tick value label on the top-right.
	Cursor spasms around when debug menu is opened and the cursor is updated due to player input (Like hovering over a unit and giving a command), perhaps update rate of GUI elements
